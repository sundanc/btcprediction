## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to forecast Bitcoin's future price using past data. The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Historical Bitcoin price data is collected and preprocessed.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualization of Bitcoin price trends over time to understand its behavior.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features based on technical indicators like moving averages, daily returns, etc.
4. **Model Building**: Training a machine learning model to predict Bitcoin prices using features from the preprocessed data.
5. **Evaluation and Prediction**: Evaluate the model's performance and generate predictions for future Bitcoin prices.
